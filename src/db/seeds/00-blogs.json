You’ll hear more about what it means to be a stranger who, in the redemptive process, can begin to use their sense of alienation and isolation on behalf of the kingdom as a prophet. As Dan notes, in our world today we desperately need to listen to prophets who tell the truth, and open the door to imagination and redemptive hope.",

Most of us sitting around my fireplace that night had young kids sleeping in various places around the house, and we, as their parents, were exhausted, drinking one too many glasses of champagne that would come back to bite us the next morning as our children would inevitably wake at an ungodly hour welcoming in the New Year.",

Cathy shares how she stumbled on the movie on HBO this summer and immediately started alerting our team about it; Dan recalls that it was less of a recommendation than a command: You need to watch this film.",

    "text": "This week, Dan continues his conversation with Cathy Loerzel, Executive Vice President, about The Tale, Jennifer Fox’s powerful, devastating film that is available to stream on HBO or Amazon. Cathy and Dan discuss more of the dynamics that make this such an important work of art, and they reflect on categories for further discussion and exploration—like the surprising and disturbing presence of arousal even in the midst of abuse.",

    "text": "I am in the middle of moving, over Christmas, with a one-year-old baby, and I don’t wanna. I mean, I do—it is an amazing gift to our family to be able to move from our cramped townhouse into a beautiful house with a huge yard for our very active son to play in. We are thrilled and I want to cry. There are many reasons for this. First, moving is just hard—regardless of your circumstances. It is laborious, tedious, expensive, and fraught with details that would drive anyone mad. Second, it means change—deep change. And for those of us who like comfort and routine, this change can be undoing to the core.",
