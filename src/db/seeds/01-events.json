The other person might be a family member, friend, co-worker, or client. Engaging someone’s story is part art and part science. It can be learned! It is not a magical ability that some people have and some people don’t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><p>There are certain principles that apply—principles that can be learned—that’s the science part. And then there are techniques that need to be <i>caught</i> by watching others do it—that’s the art part.
